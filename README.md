# PowerPilot

PowerPilot is a Wiâ€‘Fi energy meter built for accurate, IECâ€‘compliant monitoring of electrical systems â€” singleâ€‘phase and threeâ€‘phase (WYE/DELTA) up to 500â€¯A at 120â€¯V/230â€¯V. It measures realâ€‘time RMS voltage, current, active/reactive/apparent power, kWh, and frequency, then securely streams data via MQTT or HTTP into a Dockerized backend (Debian â†’ Django REST â†’ PostgreSQL) for local or cloud storage, visualization, and analytics.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- âœ… Supports singleâ€‘phase & threeâ€‘phase configurations  
- âœ… Configurable for North American (120â€¯V) & European (230â€¯V) standards  
- âœ… Highâ€‘accuracy ADE7758 energyâ€‘meter IC + 500â€¯A splitâ€‘core CT sensors  
- âœ… ESP32 firmware with OTA, MQTT + REST API support  
- âœ… Docker Compose stack: Django, PostgreSQL, Nginx  
- âœ… React dashboard for live monitoring & historical reporting  
- âœ… Modular design: add LoRaWAN, Modbus, Home Assistant integrations  
- âœ… IEC/ULâ€‘compliant safety (isolated supplies, surge protection)

Perfect for DIY, commercial, and renewableâ€‘energy monitoring applications â€” take control of your energy usage and unlock actionable insights today!
